### Installing Java Development Kit (JDK):

1. **Download JDK:** Visit the Oracle website or OpenJDK to download the JDK installer compatible with your operating system.
2. **Install JDK:** Run the installer and follow the installation instructions provided.

### Installing Eclipse:

1. **Download Eclipse:** Go to the Eclipse website and download the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.
2. **Install Eclipse:** Extract the downloaded Eclipse package to a preferred location on your system.

### Configuring Eclipse to Use JDK:

1. **Open Eclipse:** Launch the Eclipse IDE.
2. **Configure JDK in Eclipse:**
   - Go to "Window" > "Preferences".
   - In the Preferences window, navigate to "Java" > "Installed JREs".
   - Click on "Add..." to add the JDK to Eclipse. Select "Standard VM" and click "Next".
   - Click on "Directory..." or "Search..." to locate and select the JDK directory you installed earlier.
   - Click "Finish" and ensure the added JDK is checked.

### Creating a Java Project in Eclipse:

1. **Create a New Java Project:**
   - Go to "File" > "New" > "Java Project".
   - Enter the project name and click "Finish".

### Writing and Running Java Code:

1. **Create a Java Class:**
   - Right-click on the "src" folder in the created project.
   - Select "New" > "Class".
   - Enter the class name and select the option to create a `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
   - Click "Finish".

2. **Write Java Code:**
   - Inside the created class, write your Java code.

3. **Run Java Code:**
   - Right-click on the Java file containing the `main` method.
   - Select "Run As" > "Java Application".

### Troubleshooting:

- If Eclipse does not detect the installed JDK, check the JDK installation directory and ensure it's correctly added in Eclipse preferences.
- Verify that the Java project is configured to use the correct JDK.

By following these steps, you should be able to install Java, set up Eclipse, create Java projects, and write/execute Java code within Eclipse.
